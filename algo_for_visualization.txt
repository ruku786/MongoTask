To connect to an S3 bucket using a visualization tool for analysis.
We can Use tools like Power BI, Tableau and AWS QuickSight.

I am giving the example of Amazon Quick sight here:

Step 1:  Open Amazon QuickSight.
Step 2: Create a new dataset.
Step 3: Choose "Amazon S3" as the data source.
Step 4: Enter your AWS credentials.
Step 5: Configure the dataset by specifying the S3 bucket and file location.
Step 6: Define the schema and data transformations as needed.
Step 7: Create the dataset.


Load, Visualize Data and Save:
Select the specific data files or objects you want to analyze within your S3 bucket.
Build your visualizations and reports using the prepared data.
Save your analysis project.
